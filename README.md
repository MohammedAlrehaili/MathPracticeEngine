# 🎯 Math Quiz Console Game (C++)

A simple interactive arithmetic quiz game written in **C++**.
The program generates random math questions and challenges the player to solve them.
At the end, the game evaluates the performance and decides whether the player **passed or failed**.

This project was created as a practice project to improve problem-solving, structs, enums, loops, and input validation in C++.
